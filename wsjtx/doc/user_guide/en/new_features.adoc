=== New in Version {VERSION}

*Improvements to decoders*

*FT4:* Corrected bugs that prevented AP (_a priori_) decoding and/or
multi-pass decoding in some circumstances.  Improved and extended the
algorithm for AP decoding.

*FT8:* Decoding is now spread over three intervals.  The first starts
11.8 s into an Rx sequence and typically yields around 85% of the
possible decodes, so you see most decodes much earlier than before.  A
second processing step starts at 13.5 s, and the final one at 14.7 s.
Overall decoding yield on crowded bands is improved by 10% or more.
Systems with receive latency greater than 0.2 s will see smaller
improvements, but will still see many decodes earlier than before.

SNR estimates no longer saturate at +20 dB, and large signals in the
passband no longer cause the SNR of weaker signals to be biased low.
Times written to cumulative journal file ALL.TXT are now correct even
when the decode occurs after the T/R sequence boundary.  In FT8
DXpedition Mode, AP decoding is now implemented for Hounds when the
Fox has a compound callsign.


*JT4:*  Formatting and display of averaged and Deep Search decodes has
been cleaned up and made consistent with other modes used for EME and
extreme weak-signal work on microwave bands.

*JT65:*  Many improvements have been made for averaged and Deep Search
decodes, and their display to the user.  For details see <<VHF_JT65,JT65>>
in the <<VHF_AND_UP,VHF+ Features>> section of this guide.

*WSPR:* Significant improvements have been made to the WSPR decoder's
sensitivity, its ability to cope with many signals in a crowded
sub-band, and its rate of undetected false decodes.  We now use up to
three decoding passes.  Passes 1 and 2 use noncoherent demodulation of
single symbols and allow for frequency drifts up to Â±4 Hz in a
transmission.  Pass 3 assumes no drift and does coherent block
detection of up to three symbols.  It also applies bit-by-bit
normalization of the single-symbol bit metrics, a technique that has
proven helpful for signals corrupted by artifacts of the subtraction
of stronger signals and also for LF/MF signals heavily contaminated by
lightning transients.  With these improvements the number of decodes
in a crowded WSPR sub-band typically increases by 10 to 15%.

*New message format:* When *EU VHF Contest* is selected, the Tx2 and
Tx3 messages -- those conveying signal report, serial number, and
6-character locator -- now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This
change is *not* backward compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so
all users of *EU VHF Contest* messages should be sure to upgrade to
version 2.2.0.  See <<CONTEST_MSGS,Contest Messages>> for details.

*Minor enhancements and bug fixes*

- *Save None* now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

- An explicit entry for *WW Digi Contest* has been added to *Special
 operating activities* on the *Settings | Advanced* tab.

- The contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

- *Keyboard shortcuts* have been added as an aid to accessibility:
*Alt+R* sets Tx4 message to RR73, *Ctrl+R* sets it to RRR.

- The *Status bar* now displays the number of decodes found in the
most recent Rx sequence.

- As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "`inverted goal posts`"
marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now in a
darker shade of green.

NOTE: *Notes* containing information that may be of interest to
particular classes of users.

TIP: *Tips* on program features or capabilities that might otherwise be
overlooked.

IMPORTANT: *Warnings* about usage that could lead to undesired

=== User Interface in Other Languages

Thanks to Xavi Perez, EA3W, in cooperation with G4WJS, the _WSJT-X_
user interface is now available the Catalan language.  Spanish will
follow soon, and other languages when translations are made.  When a
translated user interface is available for the computer's default
System Language, it will appear automatically on program startup.

=== How You Can Contribute

_WSJT-X_ is part of an open-source project released under the
{gnu_gpl} (GPLv3). If you have programming or documentation skills or
would like to contribute to the project in other ways, please make
your interests known to the development team.  We especially encourage
those with translation skills to volunteer their help, either for
this _User Guide_ or for the program's user interface.

The project's source-code repository can be found at {devrepo}, and
communication among the developers takes place on the email reflector
{devmail}.  Bug reports and suggestions for new features, improvements
to the _WSJT-X_ User Guide, etc., may be sent there as well.  You must
join the group before posting to the email list.
